      <a href="https://www.gdschacks.com">GDSC Hacks</a> is a hackathon hosted by the Google Developer Student Club at Guelph, 
      where students collaborate for 30 hours to develop unique software projects from scratch. 
      We empower participants by offering a variety of resources, including workshops, mentoring, 
      fun events, and sponsorship opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
    As part of the organizing team, I helped with sponsorship outreach and partnership coordination, 
    ultimately securing over $8,000 in funding and forming a key collaboration with the one and only Major League Hacking (MLH)! Through that
    collaboration we got huge sponsors like GitHub and Google. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Once sponsorship was in place, I led the execution of a targeted marketing strategy (with zero paid efforts) that attracted 
    over 850 applicants. I had to think outside the box and reflect on how I could disperse the news to anyone who may be interested. Some efforts included
    reaching out to other GDSC chapters across Ontario, lecture hall visits where I pitched the event to hundreds of students, and of course social media posts.
    Through consistent engagement and strategic promotion, we achieved an impressive 68% turnout rate, well above 
    average for university hackathons.
    <br>
    <br>
    Beyond the logistics, I was also hands-on during the 3 day event itself, mentoring participants and serving as a judge for final project 
    submissions. I provided technical guidance on machine learning, front-end development, and overall project design/impact to over 200 students, 
    many of whom were attending their first hackathon. The experience deepened my skills in community building, technical mentorship, and 
    cross-functional coordination, all while balancing the fast-paced, high-stakes environment that defines student-run tech events.
