  <p>
    My term as Marketing Director at <a href="https://www.gdscguelph.com">GDSC Guelph</a> was an incredibly rewarding experience. 
    I managed a marketing team of 4 Digital Designers and chaired weekly meetings where I assigned action items, coordinated campaign 
    timelines, and kept communication flowing between our design, tech, and events teams. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I created marketing campaigns tailored to our student audience, resulting in an average turnout of 80–120 students per event, often 
    exceeding expectations. This was done through a combination of lecture hall visits to pitch the event a large volume of students (as shown in slide 1 of the carousel),
    all the way to emailing the undergrad computing chain. 
    I marketed workshops on tools like React, Flutter, and Firebase, which helped bridge the gap between the 
    curriculum and real-world technical skills. I also analyzed our marketing metrics to track campaign performance and used those insights 
    to make data-driven decisions that improved reach and engagement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond strategy, I was also super hands-on: I directed post designs to match the visual identity of our feed, gathered event content, 
    snapped photos at sessions, and even made silly short-form reels to keep things fun and relatable. Feel free to check them out on our Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/gdsc_guelph/">@GDSC_Guelph</a>)! 
    At our peak, we hit over 40K Instagram
     profile views, and the follower count doubled by the end of my term.
  </p>

  <p>
    Best of all, I became close friends with my team :) we collaborated effectively but also laughed a ton. It was one of the most fulfilling
     and memorable leadership roles I’ve taken on.
