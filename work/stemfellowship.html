      STEM Fellowship's <a href="https://stemfellowship.org/big-data-and-ai-inquiry-and-experiential-learning/big-data-courses/inter-university-big-data-challenge/">IUBDC</a> 
      aims to create an interdisciplinary, experiential learning environment where students from different universities and backgrounds collaborate on real-world data problems. It bridges 
      academic learning and industry practice by engaging participants in agile, project-based work that builds essential data science skillsâ€”such as analytical reasoning, 
      machine learning, and collaborationâ€”while promoting scholarly communication and cross-institutional teamwork
    </p>

    For the Inter-University Big Data & AI Challenge, I led a team of five on a project to predict adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in elderly patients using real-world hospital data. As the 
    Project Manager, I organized weekly meetings, assigned tasks, and kept everything on track using Trello and Gantt chartsâ€”we even finished the whole thing a week early.
    On the technical side, I built and tested several machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regressionâ€”and ended up with a model that hit 89% accuracy. We used the MIMIC-IV 
    dataset, which has info on over 425,000 emergency department visits, and processed it all with pandas to extract the features we needed.

    The project was eventually published in the STEM Fellowship Journal (which only accepts about 25% of submissions) and also featured on Underline. You can check out the code and read more about what 
    we did here: ðŸ”— <a href="https://github.com/arzow-m/iubdc">GitHub Repository<a>
