  <div class="project-description">
    <p> Getting elected as First-Year Rep in my first semester of university was such a meaningful 
        experience—especially since I was up against 9 other candidates! I honestly didn’t expect to win, 
        but I kept putting myself out there, meeting new people, and rallying support right up until the results 
        came out :) 
        <br>
        <br> 
        The <a href="https://www.cepssc.com">CEPSSC</a> (basically the student union for my college) 
        gave me the chance to help plan a ton of events, from professional LinkedIn workshops to Valentine’s Day goodie giveaways. 
        I helped coordinate communication between students and the council, which boosted engagement with our events and initiatives. 
        We were able to reach and impact over 500 first-year students through our programming! </p> <p> I also got to attend weekly 
            board meetings where we discussed budgets, allocated funding to ASOs (student clubs under CEPS), brainstormed event ideas, and 
            tackled issues within our student governance system. It was a fun mix of learning how things work behind the scenes and actually 
            helping to shape the first-year experience for a lot of my peers. </p>
